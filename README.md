## 🚧 Project Status

This project is **pre-launch** and not yet available for public use.

The codebase is evolving rapidly, and major components, APIs, and workflows are subject to change. This repository is published intentionally to share progress and provide transparency as development continues.

## What This Is

This platform explores new approaches to building the right relationships in the current real estate market.

The focus is on:
- Seamless, user-friendly ways to interact with others.
- Carefully considered, thoughtful Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrations.
- Quality of Life (QoL) enhancements for all.

More details will be shared as the project moves closer to public release.
